## Welcome to The Journey's Eve Online Corporation Page.

EVE Online is a video game by CCP Games. According to [fandom's wiki page](https://eve.fandom.com/wiki/EVE_Online), it is a "player-driven persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)." Eve's universe is set 21,000 years into future. It spans over 7,500 star systems. Players are able to navigate between these star systems by means of "star-gates". 

Each of these star systems can be host to various phenomena such as; moons, planets, stations, wormholes, asteroid belts etc. These in turn can be used by players (capsuleers) to extract resources such as raw minerals, gases, and space debris such as destroyed ships etc. These resources can be mined, salvaged, hacked, analyzed and converted into other materials which can then be sold, traded etc in game, or [out of game](http://evewiz.com/270-pirate-faction-eve-ships). 

How will Christian ethics affect such game play?
