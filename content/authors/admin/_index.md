It's often remarked by various media the extent to which activities which occur within a MMO affect events in the [real world](https://www.pcgamer.com/most-expensive-eve-online-ship-sale-ever-to-benefit-australian-wildfire-relief/). Further, games such as EVE can provide for very interesting discussions about the impact of [individual decisions in larger economies](https://www.academia.edu/10278352/Virtual_Worlds_Real_Economics). But lastly, a most interesting discussion involves religious motivation towards such participation, particularly Christian. In a virtual game play simulated 21,000 years into the future, how will Christian ethics affect, or be affected by virtual game play?
