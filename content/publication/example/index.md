abstract: In her paper *Literary Fiction and the value of detail*, Eileen John wonders "...what is the philosophical value of detailed thought about imagined individuals?" In this proposed paper topic, I question whether this thought can be explored in the context of MMORPGs.I ask this specifically in the context of a fictional future world. Here, the actions of individual choices in the context of the game have greater implications than those of the average Christian. I propose that we compare in game choices with those Christian leaders are sometimes encouraged to make.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
