You might be wondering what this is all about... Well, assuming that you have already gone through the initial steps in the introduction post, join us Wednesday February 2, 2021 for our first virtual Journey through EVE. Here, we will get used to the environment, learn helpful tips, perform our first communal mission, and most importantly, have fun.
