1. First, you must create an account using this [referral link](https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=904a9801-e700-49ef-a81f-82c2b3ae0b68). It doesn't cost anything and it will start you off with 1,000,000 [skill points](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills_and_learning) which you can use to train up your character saving you about 2-3 weeks of game play.
2. Next, after creating an account and installing the game, you must create a character. Here are some things to keep in mind when creating your character:
  1. You must choose a race. This is primarily an aesthetic choose as you can fly any ship, train any skill and play any role. However, the race you choose does determine in small part, which skills you begin with.
  2. Bloodline or family ancestry. This determines which starter corporations you can join but this will largely be irrelevant since [**A Journey Through EVE**](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Corporations) is its own player corporation which we will all belong to.
  3. School. Once again, this will only determine where you begin. However, we will need to set up our own home where each of our ships can avatars will call home. I recommend a system close to where our home system will be. This will be determined at a later date.
  4. Portrait and appearance.
  5. Name. This is permanent, so choose accordingly.

# Starting the Game

1. Certainly go through the tutorial.
2. Career agents. These agents are great. It's best to go through each. There are about 10 missions for each agent and with each one, you will gain isk (in-game currency), equipment such as ships, modules, etc, and most important of all experience. We might do these together as a group in the future. However, if you would like to do it on your own, that's fine too.
3. The Sisters of EVE Epic Ark. These will be fun to do as a group. However the rewards will be earned individually so what we can do is split into pairs and complete this missions. The sooner we complete these, the sooner we can begin to build our own society within EVE! In EVE, there are various areas each categorized according to how safe you will be in that area. [Highsec offers the most security](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System_security#High_Security) and a new capsuleer can expect to remain fairly safe while navigating throughout. The SEEA missions will have you travel throughout this area to a point where you can become quite comfortable. To complete, we will need to travel to the [Arnon](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Essence/Arnon#sec) system.
4. In EVE Online, skills determine which ships you can fly, how you can equip them, modules, turrets, ammunition etc. Skills also determine what you can buy and sell and how you can do it. These are actually really really important.
5. [Fitting your Ship](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Getting_Started_in_EVE_Online). Ships in EVE can be fitted with a wide variety of modules which grant the ship additional abilities. This includes things like weapons, which allow you to fire at enemy ships. They also enhance its statistics. E.g. armor plates increase the amount of damage your ship can take before exploding. Learning which modules work well on which ship and in combination with which other modules is a potentially very deep topic, so you should approach it step by step. Basic guidelines for fitting each of the four factions' ships can be found on the following pages:
  1. [Amarr Basic Ship and Skill Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Amarr_Basic_Ship_and_Skill_Overview)
  2. [Caldari Basic Ship and Skill Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Caldari_Basic_Ship_and_Skill_Overview) 
  3. [Gallente Basic Ship and Skill Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gallente_Basic_Ship_and_Skill_Overview) 
  4. [Minmatar Basic Ship and Skill Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Minmatar_Basic_Ship_and_Skill_Overview)
  5. [ORE Basic Ship and Skill Overview](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/ORE_Basic_Ship_and_Skill_Overview) 

Additionally, there is a [complete list](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Fitting_Modules_and_Rigs_Guide) of all modules and rigs, and what they do. EVE University members can also ask for fitting advice in the EVE University PvP and PvE ship setup forums or the [#fitting-chat Discord channel](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Discord).

It's also a good idea to set up [PYFA](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/PYFA), a popular tool that lets you build and simulate fittings out of game. PYFA will let you easily simulate fittings and see what skills you'll need to train to fly them.
6. Joining a Corporation. At its heart, A Journey Through EVe is a corporation. We all have a specific goal, fellowship and discipleship. EVE is merely another platform to do that in. However, it might be beneficial for us the corporately join another corporation to help us get started and gain experience. This corporation is called [EVE University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Welcome_to_EVE_University) and actually wrote the getting started list which I used for this post. The corporation you join is important. For instance, I joined one corporation which had an enormously high corporate tax rate. What this meant is that for every isk I earned, this corporation automatically took almost 20%. Stupid tax I guess. EVE University will give us the experience we need while hopefully avoiding the stupid tax. This can be a point we discuss in our first meeting.
